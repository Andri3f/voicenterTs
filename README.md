## screen-width && Burger Menu

I added a plugin that tracks the screen width and applies corresponding classes to ensure the burger menu functions properly.

## Smooth Scrolling

I implemented smooth scrolling using a simple JS scrollTo method. I tried using vue-scroll, but it didn’t work, so I switched to the native JS solution.

## API Interaction

I handled the interaction with the API through the store and fetched the data. I retrieved the data in index.vue and subsequently passed it to the components.

## Technologies Used

Nuxt 3 for app development.
CSS for styling (responsive design for mobile and tablet).
Libraries: FontAwesome, Swiper.
perl
